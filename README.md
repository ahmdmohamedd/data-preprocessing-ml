# Data Preprocessing for Machine Learning  

This project demonstrates an advanced data preprocessing pipeline designed for machine learning tasks. The pipeline efficiently prepares a large dataset for predictive modeling while handling common challenges like missing values, categorical encoding, and feature scaling.  

## Overview  

Preprocessing is a crucial step in building machine learning models. This project addresses key aspects of data preparation, including:  
1. Cleaning and transforming raw data for analysis.  
2. Encoding categorical variables using frequency encoding.  
3. Scaling numerical features for improved model performance.  
4. Managing memory usage efficiently when working with large datasets.  

The project is implemented in a step-by-step format, suitable for Jupyter Notebook.  

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is a large-scale taxi trip dataset containing the following columns:  
- `id`: Unique identifier for each trip.  
- `pickup_datetime`: Timestamp of when the trip started.  
- `trip_duration`: Target variable indicating the trip duration in seconds.  
- Other categorical and numerical features related to the trip.  

The dataset was pre-processed to remove irrelevant columns and handle both categorical and numerical features.  

## Key Features  

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed non-feature columns like `id` and `pickup_datetime`.  
   - Addressed missing values where applicable.  

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   - Frequency encoding for categorical variables to replace memory-intensive one-hot encoding.  
   - Ensured all columns were numeric for compatibility with machine learning models.  

3. **Feature Scaling**  
   - Applied standardization using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to scale numerical features.  

4. **Memory Optimization**  
   - Replaced one-hot encoding with frequency encoding to handle large datasets without memory errors.  

5. **Train-Test Split**  
   - Split the processed data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.  

## Results  

- Training set shape: `(553887, 10)`  
- Testing set shape: `(138472, 10)`  

This preprocessing pipeline demonstrates an efficient and scalable approach to preparing data for machine learning.
